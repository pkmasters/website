      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the documentation page! Here you'll find detailed information about how I set up my website and the services I host.</p>

      <!-- Section for Website Setup -->
      <h3>Website Setup</h3>
      <p>I am using a Cloudflare domain from their registrar, which is a paid service per year. My website is hosted on GitHub Pages, where I created a pages repository and linked my domain to it. Additionally, I created a DNS record on Cloudflare to point to the GitHub Pages IP address. The website is built using simple HTML and CSS files.</p>
      
      <!-- New Section for Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunneling -->
      <h4>Accessing Services with Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunneling</h4>
      <p>To access all of my services over the internet securely, I use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" target="_blank">Cloudflare's Zero Trust Tunneling service</a>. This allows me to create subdomains that point to my internal services without exposing my home IP address.</p>
      <p>With Zero Trust, I can define specific access controls, ensuring that only authorized users can access the web interfaces of my services. This includes a verification step before granting access, which adds an additional layer of security. By doing so, I protect my services from unauthorized access while allowing seamless connectivity for legitimate users.</p>

      <!-- Section for Hosting Services -->
      <h3>Hosting Services</h3>
      <p>I have a home server based on an HP Compaq Elite 8300, running Proxmox as a Type 1 hypervisor. I have Ubuntu Server installed as a VM because it is lightweight, and all management is done through SSH and the command line.</p>
      <p>Inside the Ubuntu Server, I installed <a href="https://casaos.io/" target="_blank">CasaOS</a>, which is a user-friendly platform for managing self-hosted Docker applications.</p>

      <!-- Subsection for Services on CasaOS -->
      <h4>Services Hosted on CasaOS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Helpdesk:</strong> I am using Peppermint for ticket management.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring Service:</strong> Uptime Kuma for monitoring service uptime.</li>
        <li><strong>AdGuard Home:</strong> A DNS sinkhole for blocking unwanted content.</li>
        <li><strong>Nextcloud:</strong> A personal cloud solution for file storage.</li>
        <li><strong>VaultWarden:</strong> A private password manager.</li>
        <li><strong>Apache Guacamole:</strong> For web GUI management of all hosts.</li>
        <li><strong>Kasm:</strong> A private browser instance.</li>
        <li><strong>Crafty:</strong> My Minecraft server.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Section for Crafty and Playit.gg -->
      <h3>Crafty and Tunneling Setup</h3>
      <p>For my Minecraft server (Crafty), I use <a href="https://playit.gg/" target="_blank">Playit.gg</a> as a tunneling service. This allows me to create a secure tunnel to my server without exposing my home IP address.</p>
      <p>After setting up Playit.gg, I create DNS records on my domain to point the Playit.gg server address to my subdomain, ensuring that players can connect easily to my Minecraft server.</p>
