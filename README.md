# How I setup my website

Hey there! This is where I share how I set up my website using GitHub Pages.

### The Setup

I used **GitHub Pages** to host my site. It's super easy and free, plus it works really well with custom domains, especially when combined with **Cloudflare** for managing my domain.

### Here’s how it all works:

- **GitHub Pages** is handling the hosting. I just pushed my HTML files to this GitHub repo, and it’s live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name`.
  
- **Cloudflare** is doing the domain magic. I pointed my domain (like `www.mywebsite.com`) to GitHub using Cloudflare's DNS setup. This way, when people type in my custom domain, they get directed straight to my GitHub Pages site.

- Everything’s pretty simple — just HTML and CSS files for now! My structure is basic, but it works perfectly for my needs.

### Some Details:
- I’ve got my HTML files in the main repo, and you can find them right there in the root folder.
- Cloudflare takes care of the domain, and GitHub handles the hosting. All you need to do is make sure DNS is set up properly, and GitHub knows about your custom domain (you can do that in the settings).
